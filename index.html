        <p>I am a Professor at Lewis University and Chair of the Department of Engineering, Computing and Mathematical
            Sciences. I grew up in the Milwaukee area and attended the University
            of Wisconsin where I earned a BBA in Accounting and Information Systems. After working for 10 years in the
            financial industry,
            I decided to go back to school and earn a degree in Computer Science. I received a MS in Computer Sceince
            from Governors State University
            and earned my PhD from the University of Illinois at Chicago where my advisor was
            <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/DiEugenio">Barbara Di Eugenio.</a>
        </p>

        <p>My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am
            also interested in
            the use of AI in education. I'm currently working on a project to update my courses to incorporate
            the use of AI.</p>
        <p>In addition to my teaching and research, I am also the faculty advisor for the Lewis University chapter of <a
                href="https://women.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM-W</a>. This is a professional organization that
            supports and advocates for women in computing. Additionally, I run the <a
                href="https://cs.lewisu.edu/gct/about.html" target="_blank"> Girls Create with Technology</a> program.
            This program is designed to engage girls in computer science and STEM activities. Girls participating in the
            program will receive advanced training in various aspects of Computer Science from Lewis University faculty
            and students.
        </p>

        <p>I currently live near Milwaukee (yes, I know that's a long commute) with my husband, Doug.
            In my spare time, I like to read mysteries and historical fiction. I also like to
            to watch live music, boat and travel. </p>
