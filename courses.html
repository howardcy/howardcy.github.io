  <p class="lead">Teaching is the most important part of my job.  I strive to engage my students in class through the use of interesting examples
    and hands-on exercises.  But teaching extends beyond the classroom and I encourage all students to get to me better by visiting me during office
    hours or electroncially through email.</p>
	<h4>Here are some of the courses that I am currently teaching or have taught in the past</h4>

		<p><strong>Introduction to Computer Science:</strong> This course explores the field of computer science.
		It provides an overview of computer architecture, networking, data organization and computational
		theory. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts underlying all of computing, such as
		algorithms, abstractions, and how computers represent numbers, text, images, and sound.
		Students also learn the basics of programming and computational problem solving using innovative programming
		environments and techniques.
  </p>


		<p><strong>Data Structures</strong>:  This course provides a study of dynamic structures in the field of computer science and their applications.  Topics include linked list, multilinked lists, binary trees, and graphs.  The course uses the  C++ programming language.</p>
		<p><strong>Object-oriented Programming</strong>:  Students are introduced to JAVA programming using the JAVA Development Toolkit (JDK)
		    from Sun Microsystems. Object-based programming techniques are presented. Other topics include JAVA building elements,
		    control structures, methods, arrays and strings, and graphics programming.
		    <a href="http://www.finchrobot.com/" target="_blank">Finch robots</a> are used as tangible objects to
		    emphasize object-oriented concepts.</p>
		<p><strong>Software Engineering</strong>:  This is one of the capstone options in our program.  Students in this class work in teams
		to complete a real-world software project for an organization. Often, our clients are non-profit organizations that serve the surrounding community.</p>
		<p><strong>Mobile Application Development</strong>:  In this course, students learn how to create applications for Android devices.  By the end of the semester, each student or group of students
		will have completed a game or productivity application that can be deployed on a mobile device.</p>
		<p ><strong>Applied Programming Languages</strong>: The goal of the course is to increase studentsâ€™ programming skills while helping them develop good
		    programming methodology and style. This course also gives students experience using code management systems and
		    working on open-source programming projects.</p>
